## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows you to build scalable and efficient network applications. This repository covers essential concepts that form the foundation of Node.js development.

## Call Stack

The call stack is a mechanism for tracking function calls in your code. It helps maintain the order of execution.

## Event Loop

The event loop is a fundamental part of Node.js that enables non-blocking I/O operations by efficiently handling asynchronous events.

## Events

Node.js's event-driven architecture allows you to work with events and event listeners to manage asynchronous operations.

## Child Processes

Node.js provides various ways to create child processes for executing external commands.

### exec

The `exec` function runs shell commands asynchronously and provides a callback for handling results.

### fork

`fork` is used to create new Node.js processes. It's especially useful for creating multiple child processes that can communicate with each other.

### spawn

The `spawn` function is used to launch new processes, making it ideal for handling large data chunks.

## Timers

Timers in Node.js allow you to schedule tasks for future execution using `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.

## Thread Pool

Node.js employs a thread pool to manage asynchronous I/O operations, preventing the event loop from being blocked.

## Worker Threads

Node.js supports worker threads for executing JavaScript in parallel, which is useful for computationally intensive tasks.

## Examples

### Simple HTTP Server

A basic example of creating a simple HTTP server using the `http` module.

### Event Emitter

Creating a custom event emitter using the `events` module to demonstrate event-driven programming.

### Child Process Example

An example showcasing the use of child processes, including `exec`, `fork`, and `spawn`.

### Timers and Intervals

Using timers and intervals to execute functions at specific intervals.

### Worker Threads Example

Demonstrating the usage of worker threads to parallelize a task.
